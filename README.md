## Creational Patterns
### Singleton
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Builder
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### Factory Method
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


### Abstract Method
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
